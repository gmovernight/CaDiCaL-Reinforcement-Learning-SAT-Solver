Yes — the Implementation section should explain what you built and how it works, not dump code. Aim for clear responsibilities, interfaces, and key decisions, with concise file pointers. Use this structure.

Architecture

Explain the system diagram: solver → bridge → env → policy → action → solver.
Define roles: solver hooks, bridge API, env shaping, policy/value, trainer, scripts.


Solver Instrumentation

What you added to CaDiCaL: decision override, K‑candidate snapshot, step/window counters.
Contract of the hook: runs to next decision, returns global stats + top‑K; accepts (index, M) to force next decisions.
Pointers: cadical/src/internal.hpp, cadical/src/internal.cpp, cadical/src/decide.cpp.


Bridge (C++/pybind11)

Python API surface and types:
load_dimacs(path), solve_until_next_hook(K, timeout_ms), apply_action(index, M), get_metrics().
Metrics exposed (time_s, conflicts, decisions, props, props_per_dec, restarts, meanLBD_fast/slow).
Pointer: bridge/pybridge.cpp.


Environment (Python)

Observation schema: global [11], cands [K,5] with [var, evsids, bumps_recent, age, rank]; mask logic.
Step semantics: action index → window M decisions → next hook observation; episode limits.
Reward shaping: Δ(window PPD) + Δ(mean LBD) + terminal bonus/penalty; why these choices.
Pointer: env/sat_env.py, env/reward.py.


Policy Model (Actor‑Critic)

Network design: candidate encoder, global encoder, shared per‑candidate policy head, pooled value head; masking of invalids.
Shapes, activations, initialization.
Pointer: rl/models/a2c.py.


Trainer (A2C)

Loss: policy + value (Smooth L1) − entropy; advantage normalization; grad clip.
Data collection: rollout T, GAE(λ=0.95) with bootstrap; batch assembly.
Pointer: rl/train/a2c_trainer.py, rl/rollout/buffer.py, scripts/train_a2c.py.


Training Pipeline

Configs: cfg/a2c.yaml (K, M, rollout_T, lr, value/entropy coefs, grad_clip); how Stage C bumps rollout_T.
Entropy annealing schedule (start→0).
Warm‑start between stages with --init-ckpt (weights only); optional --resume for optimizer state (why/when).
Logging: per‑update JSONL; summary fields (duration, updates/sec); training_curves.png.
Pointers: scripts/train_a2c.py, scripts/save_training_summary.py, scripts/plot_training_curves.py.


Evaluation Pipeline

Baselines: cadical_default, evsids_top1, random_topK.
A2C eval modes: greedy/sample; fixed budgets (timeout_s=60, K=16, M=8).
Outputs: per‑instance JSONL; Solved%, PAR‑2, median times; bar plots and cactus plots; CSV tables.
Pointers: scripts/run_baselines.py, scripts/eval_a2c.py, scripts/plot_eval_vs_baselines.py, scripts/plot_cactus.py, scripts/make_tables.py.


Data & Splits

Families and counts: f50‑218 (SAT+UNSAT), f100‑430 (SAT+UNSAT), flat50‑115 (SAT only).
Train/val/test split hygiene; why flat is held out for generalization.
Reproducibility

Seeds, configs, checkpoints; exact build commands; device; PyTorch version.
Selection policy: choose checkpoint by val solved% (PAR‑2 tiebreaker); report on test.


Trade‑offs & Decisions

M=8 vs larger M; rollout_T (32/64) choice; reward signals (why ΔPPD + ΔLBD); warm‑start weights‑only across curriculum.
This level of detail is “code‑backed but readable”: you explain logic and interfaces, decisions and rationale, and give file pointers without overwhelming the reader with source.
